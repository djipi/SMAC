## Introduction
SubQMod’s MACro Assembler (pronounced ‘smack’), which generates code for the processors of the classic and powerful Atari Jaguar console. SMAC is a fast, single pass, assembler that supports includes files, macros, local and external symbols, limited control structures and other features. It will generate code for the Jaguar’s key chips, the GPU and DSP RISC processors, as well as the Motorola 68000 processor.

## Design
SMAC is designed to be familiar with existing Jaguar developers by operating in a near identical manner to MADMAC, Atari’s original Jaguar assembler.

## Foundation
This repository is based on the original release from SubQMod's, and updated to support more recent platforms and tools.
