## Platform
Windows 32 bits.

## Introduction
SubQMod’s MACro Assembler (pronounced ‘smack’), which generates code for the processors of the classic and powerful Atari Jaguar console. SMAC is a fast, single pass, assembler that supports includes files, macros, local and external symbols, limited control structures and other features. It will generate code for the Jaguar’s key and most powerful chips, the GPU and DSP RISC processors, as well as the Motorola 68000 processor.

## Design
SMAC is designed to be familiar with existing Jaguar developers by operating in a near identical manner to MADMAC, Atari’s original Jaguar assembler.

## Foundation
In fact, the foundation to SMAC is the MADMAC source code that existed prior to being modified for the Atari Jaguar and is used with the kind permission of its author, Landon Dyer. SMAC is partially an homage to MADMAC and the fantastic Atari Jaguar console as well as a platform to provide Windows, MAC and Linux users with the capability of once more creating great code for this great system.
